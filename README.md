# COMP303 Winter 2021
## Description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they work as expected. It will use Java for all the code examples and assignments. However, the considerations during the design process apply in all languages for practical software development.

## Expected Outcome
After completing this course successful students should be able to:

- Properly explain and apply general Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutability, interface segregation, etc.) and important Design patterns;
- Properly explain and apply design techniques such as UML Diagrams and Design by Contract;
- Effective use programming language mechanisms such as exception handling and reflection;
- Analyze and evaluate the quality of design solutions; correctly identify design smells and apply appropriate refactoring to eliminate them;
- Gain experience on software development tools such as modern IDEs, automatic documentation and testing tools, and version control system.


## Reference Material


###### Required Textbook:

## Prerequisites
COMP 206 and COMP 250. Please also perform the self assessment within the first week of the class to determine if you are ready to take this course.

## Assessment and Evaluation (Updated):



| Assessment Method  | Weight |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Participation  | 10%  |
| Peer Assessment  | 16% -- 5(A1)+5(A3)+6(A5)  |
| TA Assessment | 74% -- 18(A1/2)+18(A3/4)+18(A5)+20(A6) |



Due to the remote teaching complication, I won't require you to attend the live lectures even though it is recommended. If you are not able to attend the live lectures, please make sure to follow the recordings afterward and complete the quizzes. It will count for your participation grades.
Our TAs will try their best to support your learning. But considering this is a big class – many of you will have similar questions or concerns and many of you have will answers to other people’s questions, we encourage you to discuss your questions about the lectures and exercises online;
Every module of the lecture will come with exercises provided by the textbook. Those are for your practice and will not be graded. Instead, your practical skills will be evaluated through a series of design activities throughout the semester. Those design activities will be either assessed by your peers or our TAs. During the peer assessment, you will be graded by the quality of your reviews and discussions with your peers. The TA assessment will be done in an interactive manner using Discord.
We plan to have seven assignments throughout the semester. The first six assignments will map to different modules of the textbook, and the last one will be a final integration activity covering the entire course.
Each peer assessment will cover one assignment (i.e. assignments 1, 3, and 5) with a worth of 5 points. The grade is given based on the quality of the review you give to your peers.
There will be four interactive assessment sessions with the TAs. Each of the first three sessions will cover two assignments, i.e. session 1 covers assignments 1&2, session 2 covers assignments 3&4, session 3 covers assignments 5&6, each worth 18 points. The last session covers assignment 7 and will worth 21 points. The booking mechanism will be updated once the TA availability is confirmed.
Any form of plagiarism, cheating is strictly banned throughout the semester. Integrity is crucial to this course and your future career. Any violation against academic integrity will be taken very seriously. For more information, please refer to https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/academicrights/integrity.
